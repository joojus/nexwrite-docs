## Overview
Administrators can create, edit, and delete categories. Users can also add tags to their posts. If a tag does not match an existing category, it is automatically placed under **Other**.

## Managing Categories in the Admin Panel

The **Categories Management** section in the admin panel enables administrators to manage blog categories dynamically.

### Steps:
1. Navigate to **Admin Panel â†’ Blogs -> Topics Categories**.
2. Enter the **Category Name** and **Description**.
3. Select a **Parent Category** (optional).
4. Click **Submit** to save the category.
5. Categories appear in the list, where they can be edited or deleted.
6. If a category is deleted, all related subcategories will be reassigned to the parent category or moved to the top level.

## Conclusion
The category management system ensures efficient content organization and user-friendly navigation. Administrators maintain control over available categories, while users contribute dynamically through tags.
