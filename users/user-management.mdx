## Admin Panel UI

1. Navigate to  **Users** in the admin panel.

## Overview

- **Search Users**: Locate users by name, username, or email.
- **View Profiles**: Access user details, including email, bio, role, and follower count.
- **Block Users**: Restrict access without deleting the account.
- **Delete Users**: Permanently remove an account and its associated data.
- **Pagination**: Navigate through large user lists efficiently.

## Blocking Users

If an administrator blocks a user:
- ✅ The user **is not deleted** but **cannot log in**.
- ✅ When attempting to log in, the user will receive a block message.
- ✅ The user can contact the **site administrator** to inquire about the reason.
- ✅ The administrator can later **unblock** the user if necessary.

## Deleting Users

If an administrator deletes a user:
- ❌ The user is **permanently removed** from the database.
- ❌ All associated content (posts, comments, likes) may be deleted.
- ❌ The action **cannot be undone**.

## Admin Panel UI

### Searching Users
- Enter a **name, username, or email** in the search bar.
- Click **Clear** to reset the search field.

### Blocking a User
1. Click the **"Block User"** button.
2. The user will be **denied access to the platform**.
3. An **unblock option** will be available if needed.

### Deleting a User
1. Click the **"Delete"** button next to a user.
2. A confirmation prompt will appear before deletion.
3. Once deleted, the user **cannot be recovered**.

## Conclusion
The **User Management** system enables administrators to efficiently handle user access and maintain a secure platform. Blocking users prevents access without deleting their accounts, while deletion removes them permanently.
