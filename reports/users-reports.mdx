## User Reports List
### Endpoint:
Admins access reports via the **User Reports** page in the admin panel.

### Filters:
- **Block User** - Filter by whether the reported user is blocked (`yes`, `no`, `all`).
- **Status** - Filter reports by status (`pending`, `resolved`, `all`).

### Table Structure:
| Column        | Description |
|--------------|-------------|
| Checkbox     | Select multiple reports for bulk actions |
| User         | Reported user profile (name, username, avatar) |
| Reason       | Report reason (harassment, spam, AI-generated, etc.) |
| Reporter     | User who submitted the report |
| Status       | `pending` or `resolved` |
| Block User   | Shows whether the user is currently blocked |
| Actions      | Admin actions (block/unblock, resolve, delete) |

### Actions Available:
1. **Block/Unblock User** - Toggle block status of the reported user.
2. **Mark as Resolved** - Change report status to `resolved`.
3. **Delete Report** - Permanently delete the report entry.

### Admin Panel UI
1. Navigate to **User Reports** in the admin panel.
2. The admin can:
   - View all reported users in a table.
   - Filter reports by status (pending, resolved) and block user status.
   - Take actions on reported users (block, delete, mark resolved).

### Features
- **View Reports**: Displays reported users along with details about the reporter and reason.
- **Filter Reports**: Allows filtering based on status (`pending`, `resolved`) and block user status (`yes`, `no`).
- **Take Action**:
  - **Block User**: Prevents the reported user from posting further content.
  - **Delete User**: Removes the reported user from the platform.
  - **Resolve Report**: Marks the report as resolved without taking action.

### Usage Flow
1. Admin accesses the **User Reports** page.
2. Admin reviews the reported users with relevant details.
3. Admin selects an appropriate action:
   - Blocks the user if violations occur.
   - Deletes the user account if necessary.
   - Resolves the report if no action is required.
4. The system updates the status of the report accordingly.

### Error Handling
- **Invalid report ID:** Returns `404 Not Found`
- **Unauthorized request:** Returns `403 Forbidden`
- **Server errors:** Returns `500 Internal Server Error`

## Conclusion
The **User Reports Management** system ensures that administrators can efficiently handle reported users, maintaining a safe and compliant environment. The API endpoints allow seamless integration with moderation tools.
