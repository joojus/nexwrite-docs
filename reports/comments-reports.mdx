### Admin Panel UI
1. Navigate to **Comment Reports** in the admin panel.
2. The admin can:
   - View all reported comments in a table.
   - Filter reports by status (pending, resolved) and author block status.
   - Take actions on reported comments (delete, block author, mark resolved).

### Features
- **View Reports**: Displays reported comments along with details about the reporter and reason.

  - **Block Author**: Prevents the comment author from posting further content.
  - **Resolve Report**: Marks the report as resolved without taking action.

### Usage Flow
1. Admin accesses the **Comment Reports** page.
2. Admin reviews the reported comments with relevant details.
3. Admin selects an appropriate action:
   - Deletes the comment if necessary.
   - Blocks the author if violations occur.
   - Resolves the report if no action is required.
4. The system updates the status of the report accordingly.

### Error Handling
- **Invalid report ID:** Returns `404 Not Found`
- **Unauthorized request:** Returns `403 Forbidden`
- **Server errors:** Returns `500 Internal Server Error`
