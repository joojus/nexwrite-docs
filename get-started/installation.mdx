Welcome to the NexWrite - Medium-style blogging platform VPS Installation Guide. This step-by-step tutorial is designed to help you install and configure the script on a VPS or dedicated server.

<Note>
  This guide is for users with VPS or dedicated servers. If you are using a shared host or local environment, check the relevant installation guides.
</Note>

## Prerequisites

Ensure your server meets the [server requirements](/get-started/server-requirements). You will need:

- A clean VPS or dedicated server (Ubuntu 20.04+ recommended)
- Root or sudo access
- A domain name pointed to your server's IP
- Node.js (v18+), MongoDB (or MongoDB Atlas), and Nginx (recommended)

## Step 1: Prepare Your Server

1. **Connect via SSH:**
```bash
ssh root@your-server-ip
```

2. **Install Node.js:**
```bash
curl -fsSL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_18.x | bash -
sudo apt install -y nodejs
```

3. **Install MongoDB (optional if using Atlas):**
```bash
sudo apt install -y mongodb
```

4. **Install PM2 process manager:**
```bash
npm install -g pm2
```

5. **Install Nginx (optional, for HTTPS and proxying):**
```bash
sudo apt install nginx
```

## Step 2: Upload, Extract & Install Dependencies

1. Upload your script files via SFTP or SCP:
```bash
scp nexwrite-server-files.zip root@your-server-ip:/var/www/medium-clone
```

2. Extract the archive:
```bash
cd /var/www/medium-clone
unzip nexwrite-server-files.zip
```

3. Install backend dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

4. Ensure the public files are accessible via domain:
```bash
sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/yourdomain.com
```
Point root to:
```nginx
root /var/www/medium-clone/public;
```

<Note>
  Restart Nginx after editing:
```bash
sudo systemctl restart nginx
```
</Note>

## Step 3: Installation via Web Wizard

Once files are uploaded and dependencies are installed, open your browser:

```txt
https://yourdomain.com/install
```

<Steps>
<Step title="License Activation">
- Enter your license key.
- If you don’t know it, go to [https://license.jooj.us](https://license.jooj.us/) and log in with your purchase email.
</Step>

<Step title="Database Configuration">
- Enter your MongoDB connection URI. You can use either:

**A. MongoDB Atlas (cloud database)**

Example:
```bash
mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@<cluster>.mongodb.net/<database>?retryWrites=true&w=majority
```
(Replace `<username>`, `<password>`, `<cluster>`, and `<database>` with your actual values.)

If you are using MongoDB Atlas, you can find your connection string in your Atlas dashboard under **Database > Connect > Drivers**.

**B. Self-hosted MongoDB on VPS (local MongoDB)**

Example:
```bash
mongodb://<username>:<password>@<your-server-ip>:27017/<database>
```
(Replace `<your-server-ip>` with your VPS IP address and `<database>` with your database name.)

You will also be asked to enter a **JWT secret key**. You can either paste your own or click **Generate** to auto-generate one securely.
</Step>

<Step title="Create Admin">
- Set your full name, email, username, and password for the administrator account.
- Once saved, the server will restart automatically.
</Step>
</Steps>

## Step 4: Running the Script

1. Ensure you're in the project directory:
```bash
cd /var/www/medium-clone
```

2. Start the server using PM2:
```bash
pm2 start server.js --name="medium-clone"
```

3. Enable auto-start on reboot:
```bash
pm2 startup
pm2 save
```

Your project is now running in the background.
