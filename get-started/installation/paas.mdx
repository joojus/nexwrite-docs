title: Deploy on PaaS (Render, Railway, Heroku)
description: A complete guide to deploying the NexWrite - Medium-style blogging platform script on popular PaaS providers, including setup, license activation, and database configuration.
---

Welcome to the NexWrite PaaS Deployment Guide. This step-by-step tutorial will help you deploy and configure the NexWrite script on popular Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) providers such as **Render**, **Railway**, and **Heroku**.

<Note>
  This guide is for users deploying the script on PaaS platforms using a ZIP archive. If your script is not hosted on GitHub, follow the instructions below for manual deployment.
</Note>

## Prerequisites

Before proceeding, make sure you have:

- The **NexWrite** script as a ZIP archive (provided after purchase)
- An account on one of the supported PaaS platforms: **Render**, **Railway**, or **Heroku**
- **Node.js** version 18 or later
- A **MongoDB** database (e.g., via [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas))
- Your **NexWrite license key**
- Basic knowledge of working in the command line

---

## Step 1: Upload Your Script to the Platform

Since the script is not hosted on GitHub, you‚Äôll manually upload it to your chosen platform.

### üì¶ Render

1. Go to your [Render dashboard](https://dashboard.render.com/).
2. Click **New +** ‚Üí **Web Service**.
3. Choose **Manual Deploy**.
4. Upload your **NexWrite ZIP archive**.
5. Once uploaded, Render will unpack the archive and initialize the project.

### üöÜ Railway

1. Visit [railway.app](https://railway.app) and log in.
2. Click **New Project** ‚Üí Select **Deploy from ZIP archive**.
3. Upload your NexWrite ZIP file and follow the setup wizard.

### ‚òÅÔ∏è Heroku

1. Go to [heroku.com](https://heroku.com) and log in.
2. Create a new **app**.
3. Download and install the [Heroku CLI](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli) if you haven't.
4. Unzip the archive and deploy with Git:

<CodeBlock language="bash">
# Unzip the script locally
unzip nexwrite.zip -d medium-clone

cd medium-clone

# Initialize Git repo
git init

# Connect to Heroku app
heroku git:remote -a your-heroku-app-name

# Commit and push
git add .
git commit -m "Deploy NexWrite"
git push heroku master
</CodeBlock>

<Note>
Heroku no longer offers a free tier. Make sure your account has an active paid plan to deploy the app successfully.
</Note>

---

## Step 2: Set Build and Start Commands

In your provider‚Äôs dashboard, set the following commands:

- **Build Command**

<CodeBlock language="bash">
npm install
</CodeBlock>

- **Start Command**

<CodeBlock language="bash">
npm start
</CodeBlock>

These commands will install all dependencies and start your app.

---

## Step 3: Skip Manual Environment Variables (Handled Automatically)

You **do not need to manually configure environment variables** such as:

- `LICENSE_KEY`
- `MONGO_DB_URI`
- `JWT_SECRET`

These are set during the installation wizard at `/install`. When you open the installer in the browser, you will be guided step-by-step to enter these values securely.

---

## Step 4: Launch and Verify

Once deployment finishes:

1. Go to your live application URL (e.g. `https://your-app-name.onrender.com`).
2. You‚Äôll see the NexWrite **installation wizard**.

<CodeBlock language="txt">
https://your-app-domain/install
</CodeBlock>

---

## Step 5: Complete the Installation Wizard

Follow the wizard to complete your setup:

<Steps>
  <Step title="License Activation">
    - Enter your NexWrite license key.  
    - If you‚Äôve lost it, you can retrieve it from [https://license.jooj.us](https://license.jooj.us) using your purchase email.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Database Configuration">
    - Paste your MongoDB connection string.

      **A. MongoDB Atlas (recommended):**
      ```bash
      mongodb+srv://<user>:<pass>@<cluster>.mongodb.net/<db>?retryWrites=true&w=majority
      ```

      *(Replace `<user>`, `<pass>`, `<cluster>`, and `<db>` with your actual values.)*

      **B. Self-hosted MongoDB:**
      ```bash
      mongodb://localhost:27017/your-database
      ```

    - Generate or paste your JWT secret key.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create Admin">
    - Set admin name, email, username, and password.  
    - After saving, the server will automatically restart and your admin panel will be ready.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## After Deployment

Once the installation is complete, your site is live and ready.

- Visit your site:  
  <CodeBlock language="txt">
  https://your-app-domain
  </CodeBlock>

- Log in with your administrator credentials.

<Tip>
  Want to make changes later? Just update the ZIP archive, re-upload it, and trigger redeployment.
</Tip>
