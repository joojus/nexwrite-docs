title: Deploy on PaaS (Render, Railway, Heroku)
description: A complete guide to deploying the NexWrite - Medium-style blogging platform script on popular PaaS providers, including setup, license activation, and database configuration.
---

Welcome to the NexWrite PaaS Deployment Guide. This step-by-step tutorial will help you deploy and configure the NexWrite script on popular Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) providers such as **Render**, **Railway**, and **Heroku**.

<Note>
This guide assumes that your script is uploaded to a **private GitHub repository**. This is the recommended method to deploy on Render, Railway, and Heroku.
</Note>

---

## Prerequisites

Before proceeding, make sure you have:

- A **private GitHub repository** with the **NexWrite** script uploaded (unzip and push it to GitHub)
- An account on one of the supported PaaS platforms: **Render**, **Railway**, or **Heroku**
- **Node.js** version 18 or later
- A **MongoDB** database (e.g., via [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas))
- Your **NexWrite license key**
- Basic knowledge of working with Git and the terminal

---

## Step 1: Upload Your Script to GitHub

1. Unzip the NexWrite archive.
2. Push the contents to a new **private GitHub repository**:

<CodeBlock language="bash">
git init
git remote add origin https://github.com/your-username/your-private-repo.git
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit for NexWrite"
git push -u origin master
</CodeBlock>

<Note>
Make sure your GitHub repository is private if you're distributing commercial code.
</Note>

## Step 3: Wait for Build to Finish

Once your platform finishes building and starts the server:

1. Visit your live app URL
2. You should see the **NexWrite Installation Wizard**

<CodeBlock language="txt">
https://your-app-domain/install
</CodeBlock>

---

## Step 4: Complete the Installation Wizard

<Steps>
  <Step title="License Activation">
    - Enter your NexWrite license key.  
    - If you‚Äôve lost it, you can retrieve it from [https://license.jooj.us](https://license.jooj.us) using your purchase email.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Database Configuration">
    - Paste your MongoDB connection string.

      **A. MongoDB Atlas (recommended):**
      ```bash
      mongodb+srv://<user>:<pass>@<cluster>.mongodb.net/<db>?retryWrites=true&w=majority
      ```

      *(Replace `<user>`, `<pass>`, `<cluster>`, and `<db>` with your actual values.)*

      **B. Self-hosted MongoDB:**
      ```bash
      mongodb://localhost:27017/your-database
      ```

    - Generate or paste your JWT secret key.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create Admin">
    - Set admin name, email, username, and password.  
    - After saving, the server will automatically restart and your admin panel will be ready.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## After Deployment

Once the installation is complete, your site is live and ready.

- Visit your site:  
  <CodeBlock language="txt">
  https://your-app-domain
  </CodeBlock>

- Log in with your administrator credentials.

<Tip>
Need to update the code? Push changes to GitHub and redeploy from your PaaS dashboard.
