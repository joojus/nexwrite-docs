description: Resolve common issues encountered during the NexWrite installation process on VPS, PaaS, or localhost with this comprehensive troubleshooting guide.
---

If you're experiencing difficulties during the NexWrite installation or deployment process, this guide will help you identify and fix common issues. Below you'll find error categories with detailed solutions.

## Before You Begin

Before diving into specific problems, ensure the following:

1. Your system meets all [server requirements](/get-started/server-requirements).
2. Youâ€™re using the **latest version** of the NexWrite ZIP archive.
3. Youâ€™ve followed the appropriate installation guide for your environment:  
   [VPS](/get-started/installation), [PaaS](/get-started/installation/paas), or [Localhost](/get-started/installation/local).

## Common Issues and Solutions

<AccordionGroup>

<Accordion title="404 Error at /install or Blank Page">
If you open `/install` and get a 404 error or a blank screen:

1. **Check Nginx or hosting config**: Make sure your Nginx (or other proxy) is pointing to the `public` folder inside your project:
   ```nginx
   root /var/www/medium-clone/public;
   ```

2. **Verify that files are extracted**: Ensure the script archive was fully extracted and no files are missing.

3. **Wrong working directory**: Make sure youâ€™re running the server from the project root (`/var/www/medium-clone`).
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="MongoDB Connection Errors">
If you get a "MongoError" or "Failed to connect to MongoDB" message:

1. **Incorrect URI**: Double-check your MongoDB connection string. Examples:
   - MongoDB Atlas:
     ```bash
     mongodb+srv://user:pass@cluster.mongodb.net/dbname
     ```
   - Local MongoDB:
     ```bash
     mongodb://localhost:27017/dbname
     ```

2. **IP Whitelist (Atlas only)**: Ensure your server IP is added to the **Network Access** in MongoDB Atlas.

3. **Authentication failure**: Make sure the username and password used in your URI match the user created in your MongoDB instance.

4. **Firewall or port issue**: If self-hosted, ensure port **27017** is open.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Installation Wizard Fails or Doesn't Load">
If the `/install` page fails to load, shows a spinner forever, or crashes:

1. **Check server logs**:
   ```bash
   pm2 logs
   ```

2. **Missing .env or config issues**: During installation, no `.env` file is required â€” all variables are created automatically. Do **not** attempt to preconfigure `.env`.

3. **Browser cache**: Clear the browser cache or try opening `/install` in incognito mode.

4. **SSL misconfig**: If using HTTPS, verify your SSL certificate and redirect rules (especially with Nginx or Cloudflare).
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Server Crashes or Restarts on Its Own">
If the Node.js server crashes after install or mid-use:

1. **Check PM2 logs**:
   ```bash
   pm2 logs medium-clone
   ```

2. **Uncaught exceptions**: Common causes include:
   - Wrong JWT secret (rare if set through the wizard)
   - Invalid MongoDB connection
   - Out-of-memory issues on small VPS (upgrade to at least 2GB RAM)

3. **Fix file permission issues**:
   ```bash
   chown -R www-data:www-data /var/www/medium-clone
   ```

4. **Restart PM2 properly**:
   ```bash
   pm2 restart medium-clone
   ```
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Admin Login Not Working After Setup">
If youâ€™ve completed setup but canâ€™t log in:

1. **Wrong credentials**: Double-check spelling, case sensitivity, and extra spaces.

2. **MongoDB write failure**: If the admin account wasnâ€™t saved to the database, it's usually a connection issue. Revisit `/install`.

3. **Browser autofill conflict**: Clear your browser autofill data or try from incognito mode.

4. **Try resetting via Mongo CLI**:
   If you're advanced, log into MongoDB and reset the admin user manually (available upon request via support).

5. **Admin panel features not showing**: If you log in but donâ€™t see all admin features (e.g., missing menus or buttons), it may be caused by an expired or invalid token. Simply **log out and log back in** â€” this will refresh your session and restore full access to the admin interface.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="500 Internal Server Error or App Not Responding">
1. **Check PM2 logs**:
   ```bash
   pm2 logs medium-clone
   ```

2. **Static files not found**:
   NexWrite ships with a prebuilt frontend. If you see static file errors, ensure the contents of the `client/build` or embedded React build are present inside the `public` folder. You should not need to rebuild anything.

3. **Insufficient resources**: VPS must have **at least 2GB RAM**. Use `htop` or `top` to monitor memory usage.

4. **Port already in use**:
   Make sure no other service (e.g., previous Node process) is running on the same port.
</Accordion>

## Additional Debugging Tips

1. **Always check PM2 logs**:
   ```bash
   pm2 logs
   ```

2. **If using Nginx**, check:
   ```bash
   sudo cat /var/log/nginx/error.log
   ```

3. **Inspect your MongoDB connection separately** using a tool like **MongoDB Compass**.

4. **Verify SSL and HTTPS redirect rules** are correctly set up if you enabled HTTPS.

If you're still facing issues:

1. Collect the following information:
   - Error logs (`pm2 logs`, Nginx logs)
   - VPS specs (RAM, OS version)
   - Steps to reproduce the error
   - Screenshot or full error message

2. Contact our support team:

<Note>
Most issues are solved by checking the logs and carefully reviewing each step of the installation. If something fails, donâ€™t panic â€” 90% of problems are minor misconfigurations or missing steps.
