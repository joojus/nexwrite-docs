Welcome to the NexWrite -  Medium-style blogging platform Localhost Installation Guide. This step-by-step tutorial helps you install and configure the script on your local machine for development and testing.

<Note>
  This guide is for local installations. If you are deploying on a VPS or dedicated server, please refer to the corresponding guides.
</Note>

## Prerequisites

Ensure your system meets the [server requirements](/get-started/server-requirements). You will need:

- A computer running Windows, macOS, or Linux
- Node.js (v18+ recommended)
- MongoDB installed locally (or access to a remote MongoDB instance)
- A modern web browser

## Step 1: Prepare Your Environment

1. **Download the Script Archive**  
   After purchase, download the ZIP archive containing the script files from your account or email.

2. **Extract the Archive**  
   Unzip the archive to your desired location:
   
   <CodeBlock language="bash">
   unzip nexwrite-server-files.zip -d /path/to/medium-clone
   </CodeBlock>

## Step 2: Install Backend Dependencies

Open a terminal, navigate to the extracted folder, and run:

<CodeBlock language="bash">
cd /path/to/medium-clone
npm install
</CodeBlock>

## Step 3: Start the Server

1. **Launch the Application**  
   Start the server by running:

   <CodeBlock language="bash">
   npm start
   </CodeBlock>
   
   The server will run on your localhost (typically at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)).

2. **Verify the Server is Running**  
   Open your browser and navigate to:
   
   <CodeBlock language="txt">
   http://localhost:3000
   </CodeBlock>
   
   You should see your application's homepage.

## Step 4: Complete Installation via Web Wizard
Once files are installed and dependencies are set up, open your browser and go to:

<CodeBlock language="txt">
http://localhost:3000/install
</CodeBlock>
<Steps>
  <Step title="License Activation">
    - Enter your license key.  
    - If you donâ€™t know it, go to [https://license.jooj.us](https://license.jooj.us/) and log in with your purchase email.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Database Configuration">
    - Enter your MongoDB connection URI. You can use either:
      
      **A. MongoDB Atlas (cloud database)**
      
      ```bash
      mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@<cluster>.mongodb.net/<database>?retryWrites=true&w=majority
      ```
      *(Replace `<username>`, `<password>`, `<cluster>`, and `<database>` with your actual values.)*
      
      **B. Local MongoDB Installation**
      
     ```bash
      mongodb://localhost:27017/your-database-name
         ```
      *(Replace `your-database-name` with your desired database name.)*
      
    - Enter your **JWT secret key** by either pasting your own or clicking **Generate** to auto-generate one securely.
  </Step>


  <Step title="Create Admin">
    - Set your full name, email, username, and password for the administrator account.  
    - Once saved, the server will restart automatically.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Step 5: Running the Script

After installation is complete:

1. **Access Your Application**  
   Open your browser and navigate to:
   
   <CodeBlock language="txt">
   http://localhost:3000
   </CodeBlock>
   
   Log in using the administrator credentials you created.

<Tip>
  For efficient development, consider installing **nodemon** to automatically restart the server on code changes:
  
  <CodeBlock language="bash">
  npm install -g nodemon
  nodemon server.js
  </CodeBlock>
