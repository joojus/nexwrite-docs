title: Server Requirements
description: Ensure your server meets these requirements for a smooth installation and operation of your React + Node.js Medium Clone.
---

Welcome to the Server Requirements guide for the Medium Clone Script (React + Node.js). This guide outlines the essential server specifications and hosting options to ensure a successful deployment. Whether you're a developer or launching your own SaaS platform, this checklist will help you prepare your environment.
<Warning>
 **Important:** To run this script, you must have a **VPS or a dedicated server**. Shared hosting is not supported.
</Warning>
## Core Requirements

### Runtime Versions

Your server must support the following runtime environments:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Node.js Version" icon="node">
    18.x or later
  </Card>
  <Card title="MongoDB Version" icon="database">
    6.0 or later
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Note>
  Using the latest LTS (Long Term Support) versions of Node.js and MongoDB ensures the best performance, security, and compatibility.
</Note>

## Minimum Server Specifications

For optimal performance in production:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Memory" icon="memory">
    2 GB RAM minimum (4 GB recommended)
  </Card>
  <Card title="CPU" icon="microchip">
    2 vCPUs or more
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Note>
  Our test environment uses a 4 GB RAM / 2 vCPU VPS on Hetzner, which runs smoothly for medium traffic.
</Note>

## Hosting Recommendations

You can deploy this script on a variety of environments:

### Recommended VPS Providers

- [DigitalOcean](https://m.do.co/c/084136521a6a) — great performance, easy setup
- [Vultr](https://www.vultr.com/?ref=9690154) — budget-friendly and flexible
- [Hetzner](https://www.hetzner.com/) — powerful servers at competitive prices
- [Linode](https://www.linode.com/) — developer-friendly platform
- [Amazon EC2 (AWS)](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/) — scalable cloud infrastructure

<Warning>
  Shared hosting is not supported, as it doesn't provide Node.js or MongoDB runtime environments. Use VPS or cloud platforms.
</Warning>

### Optional: PaaS (Platform as a Service)

- [Render](https://render.com/)
- [Railway](https://railway.app/)
- [Heroku](https://heroku.com/) (Note: Free tier deprecated)

<Tip>
  For databases, you can either host MongoDB locally or use managed services like [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas).
</Tip>

## Additional Requirements

- **HTTPS Support**: SSL is required for production (can use Let's Encrypt)
- **Environment Variables**: Make sure to configure `.env` with all required keys
- **Node.js Package Manager**: `npm` or `yarn`
- **PM2 or systemd** (recommended for background service management)

## Firewall and Ports

Make sure the following ports are open on your server:

- **3000**: React frontend (during development)
- **5000**: Node.js backend (production may vary)
- **443 / 80**: HTTPS / HTTP traffic
- **27017**: MongoDB (if remote access is needed)

<Note>
  If you use Docker, ports can be mapped accordingly. Firewall rules should be set via UFW or provider dashboard.
</Note>

## Web Server Compatibility

The app can run with or without a reverse proxy, but using Nginx is recommended for production.

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Nginx" icon="server">
    Recommended reverse proxy
  </Card>
  <Card title="Apache" icon="server">
    Not recommended unless using as a static proxy only
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Tip>
  With Nginx, you can handle HTTPS, caching, and compression. See our deployment docs for configuration samples.
</Tip>

## Next Steps

Once your server meets these requirements, proceed to the installation guide:
