After successfully installing NexWrite, this guide will walk you through the initial setup process inside the admin panel. You'll learn how to access admin tools, update site branding, and configure essential options such as SEO, SMTP, and social login.

## Accessing the Admin Panel

To access the admin panel:

### Option 1: Sign in as Admin
1. Go to your live domain and visit:
   ```
   https://yourdomain.com/signin
   ```
2. Log in using the administrator credentials you created during installation.
3. Once logged in, click the **Admin Panel** button in the top navigation bar (visible to admin users only).

### Option 2: Direct URL
Simply visit:
```
https://yourdomain.com/admin
```
This URL will redirect you to the admin interface if you are authenticated.

<Note>
If you've just installed the script and some admin features are missing or not loading, **log out and log back in**. This refreshes your session and ensures all admin permissions are properly applied.
</Note>
